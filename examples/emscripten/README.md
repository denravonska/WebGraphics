This is an example for how you can create a website using the graphics library. A build script with all the necessary build commands, [build.sh](build.sh), will automatically set up a folder called "www" which contains compiled sources and HTML scripts.

Execute the build script with ```chmod +x build.sh && ./build.sh```
